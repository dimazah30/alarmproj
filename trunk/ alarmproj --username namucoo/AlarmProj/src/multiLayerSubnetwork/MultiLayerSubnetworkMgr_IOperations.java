     * <li>in which CTPs are all cross-connected and their tpMappingMode is set
     * to TM_NEITHER_TERMINATED_NOR_AVAILABLE_FOR_MAPPING. In this case G.805
     * trails could be created by the NMS by using setTPData to terminate and map 
     * CTPs that are adjacent to the CTPat the end of subnetwork connections

     * <li>in which one or more end FTP/CTPs expose G.805 TCPs e.g. CTP type F
     * referenced in <a href=../../../supportingDocumentation/SD1-18_layers.pdfSD1-18_SD1-18_layers.pdf >SD1-18 layering</a>. 
     * If all ends of the SNC terminate on this type of TP then the SNC provides
     * the full route of a G.805 Trail.</li> 
     * <li>in which one or more end CTP offer the capability to terminate and 
     * map and the SNC reaches the end CTP via the PTP/FTP containing the CTP. 
     * In this case the SNC creation also sets the tpMappingMode to
     * TM_TERMINATED_AND_AVAILABLE_FOR_MAPPING as well as creating the 
     * crossconnects. If all ends of the SNC terminate on this type of TP or 
     * any combination of this type of TP and TPs that expose G.805 TCPs (see 
     * above) then the SNC provides the full route of a G.805 Trail.</li>
     * <li>in which an end TP is a PTP (which is effectively permanently
     * "terminated and available for mapping". If all ends of the SNC terminate on 
     * this type of TP or any combination of this type of TP, CTPs offering the

     * other existing SNC route, in any administrative state. Once an EXCLUSIVE 
     * (intended) route has been created by EMS, any further creation operation 
     * which conflicts with the exclusive route shall be refused.</p>
     *
     * <p>The EMS tries to find a route for the request and if found
     * returns the SubnetworkConnection_T structure back to the NMS with the 
     * members set to the appropriate values.  The EMS should attempt to find a 
     * route that does not conflict or share CCs with any other existing SNC, 
     * before it resorts to creating a conflicting SNC or an SNC that shares 
     * CCs.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the TPs at the Aend and the Zend are already
     * in use by another SNC, the EMS may still create the SNC
     * or EXCPT_OBJECT_IN_USE or EXCPT_TIMESLOT_IN_USE may be thrown,
     * depending on its mode of operation.</p>
     *
     * <p>If there already exists
     * between the same termination points and with the same directionality and 
     * type, another SNC that is in the partial state, the EMS will still attempt 
     * to create the new SNC. If no constraint is specified, the EMS should   
     * attempt to find a different path. If constraints are specified, then the 
     * EMS attempts to create the SNC with an appropriate route.</p>
     *
     * <p>If a route cannot be found, the SNC is <b>not</b> created in the EMS 
     * and the EXCPT_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY exception 
     * is thrown (unless a more precise exception applies), indicating the 
     * reason.</p>
     *
     * <p>Depending on the SNC management mode of operation, it is acceptable for 
     * an EMS to not implement this service in which case 
     * the EXCPT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED exception is thrown.</p>
     * 
     * <p>VC SNCs are normally created over a VP network. Therefore, the VPI 
     * numbers of the VC SNCs specified with createData should match existing 
     * terminated and mapped VP CTPs. If a VPI number does not match an existing 
     * VP CTP, then the EMS may create the VP CTP as 'TERMINATED and MAPPED' if 
     * emsFreedomLevel allows it. 
     * Such a VP CTP is created with no traffic parameters. Note that such
     * automatic creation of resourceless terminated VP CTPs depends on the 
     * capability of the EMS and/or the ATM NE to support VC connections directly 
     * on ATM links (i.e., with no VP overlay network).</p>
     * 
     * <p>An NMS can request the EMS to create an ATM network routed SNC (VP or VC 
     * layer rates); the EMS will then manage the subnetwork connection as a soft 
     * PVC. The soft PVC may be completely or partially defined with regards to 
     * its source and destination TPs. The aEnd will, by definition, be the 
     * source of the Soft PVC (i.e., the originator of the call)
     * and the zEnd will be the destination (i.e., being called). In order
     * to allow the NMS to manage Soft PVCs that may have only their source 
     * TPs in the subnetwork, the ctpName parameter from TPDataList zEnd 
     * will be used to either specify the VPI and/or VCI value of the destination 
     * CTP (including EMS, managedElement, PTP/FTP and ATM_NI a.k.a., the full 
     * location in the physical ATM NE)or the address of the ATM interface on 
     * which the call will terminate and optionally the VPI/VCI values if they are 
     * specified/known by the NMS (but not the complete physical location of the 
     * VP or VC TP).<p>
     *
     * <p>Note that all SNC state transitions (including to/from PENDING and 
     * PARTIAL) are applicable to ATM VPCs and VCCs. However, the PARTIAL state 
     * should only apply to plain PVCs (intermediate CTPs of a Soft PVC are 
     * automatically created and deleted by the network elements and they do not 
     * usually notify the EMS).</p>

     * thrown so that theSNC can be passed back to the NMS.
     * The SNCState in resulting theSNC will be either SNCS_PARTIAL or

     * cross-connects on MEs have been successfully set up.  The state will be 
     * SNCS_PENDING if the EMS mode of operation prevents the activation of the 
     * SNC. The errorReason parameter is set accordingly.</p>

     *
     * <p> During activation of an SNC, the TPs of the SNC are configured, and the 
     * necessary cross-connects are established for the SNC and appropriate 
     * changes are made to tpMappingMode such that TPs that are not TP_NA have 
     * their tpMappingMode set appropriately for the SNC configuration. See also 
     * createSNC() for an explanation of tpMappingMode behaviour. An SNC can be 
     * activated while in any state. When activated that additional information
     * provided during the creation is also applied to the SNC in the network.</p>
     *
     * <p>In case of an ATM SNC (VP or VC), multiple termination points (VP 
     * CTP or VC CTP) can be created as a result of an activateSNC 
     * operation. These CTPs are all created/adjusted
     * in compliance with the egress and ingress traffic parameters provided in 
     * the tpsToModify structure. For example, a non terminated VP SNC created 
     * over 3 managed elements will result, upon activation, in the usage of 6 VP 
     * CTPs and 3 VP cross-connections.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that the activateSNC operation can be called repeatedly and 
     * eventually should succeed (except in conflict
     * cases where the SNC remains in SNCS_PENDING or SNCS_PARTIAL).
     * Should the missing cross-connects be activated in the MEs via 
     * a craft interface, for example, prior to communications to those MEs
     * being re-established, the activateSNC command ultimately should 
     * succeed when communication to the MEs is re-established 
     * (even though all cross-connects already exist).</p>
     * 
     * <p>The EMS will apply the transmissionParams specified 
     * in the tpsToModify parameter (same behaviour as
     * managedElementManager::ManagedElementMgr_I::setTPData().
     * They may be applied before or after the creation of the CCs, as 
     * appropriate. Existing TP transmission parameters for which no changes
     * were requested in tpsToModify will be left unchanged.
     * However, the alarm reporting on the TPs and the containing TPs
     * may be turned on by the EMS as part of this request,
     * unless otherwise specified via the transmission parameter
     * "AlarmReporting".  A similar behaviour is also allowed for the serviceState 
     * parameter, which may be set to IN_SERVICE for the TPs and the

     * 
     * <p>If a given entry in the list of transmission parameters specified in
     * the TPData_T can not be successfully applied to the TP, for any reason, 
     * then the errorReason field is appended with an appropriate reason text.
     * Applying transmission parameters is best-effort (where not stated 
     * otherwise) and the resulting values of the transmission parameters are 
     * provided in the updated tpsToModify parameter. If the parameter is "not

     *
     * In the case of a 3 level routing area hierarchy 
     * - CallID only: The EMS should return the routes for all connections 
     * that support any top level connection of the referenced call,

     * - CallID and mLRAName: The EMS should return the routes for all connections 
     * within the referenced MLRA that support any top level connection 
     * of the referenced call (there could be more than one top level connection for the same call 
     * passing through an MLRA). If the referenced MLRA is a routing node, 
     * then the response is an empty list. If the reference MLRA is the top level MLRA 
     * then the response will only include a list of all of the top level connections supporting the call. 
     * - CallID and sNPOrSNPPID: The EMS should return the routes for the connection(s) 
     * that originate from the referenced SNP or SNPP of the referenced call.

     * a list of all of the top level connections, that originate from the specified SNP(P), 
     * supporting the call.

     * All Routing Node Connections for a particular route will be returned 
     * regardless of any sharing of the same Routing Node Connections 
     * among distinct routes of the same Call.
     *
     * Optionally the response may include the edge and internal MLSNPP Links.</p>
